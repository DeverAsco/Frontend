# Basic Classic Helicopter HTML and JavaScript Game

This is a basic implementation of the classic Helicopter game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

## Further Exploration

- Score / Distance
  - As the helicopter moves right, the score / distance should increase. Use [context.fillText()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillText) to display the score / distance to the screen
  - Display a high score using [localSorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- Wall Gap Size
  - As the game progresses, the distance between the top and bottom wall should get smaller
- Mobile and touchscreen support
  - Allow the game to be scaled down to a phone size. See https://codepen.io/straker/pen/VazMaL
  - Support [touch controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)

**Important note:** I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
